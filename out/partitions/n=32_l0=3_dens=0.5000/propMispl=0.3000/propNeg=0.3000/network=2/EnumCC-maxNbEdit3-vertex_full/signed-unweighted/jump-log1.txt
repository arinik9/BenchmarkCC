MIP emphasis: integer feasibility.
MIP search method: dynamic search.
Parallel mode: deterministic, using up to 4 threads.

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    3,30 sec. (821,42 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0,00 sec. (0,00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0,00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0,00 sec.
