Legacy callback                                  LD
Lazy constraint(s) or lazy constraint/branch callback is present.
    Disabling dual reductions (CPX_PARAM_REDUCE) in presolve.
    Disabling presolve reductions that prevent crushing forms (CPX_PARAM_PREREFORM).
         Disabling repeat represolve because of lazy constraint/incumbent callback.
