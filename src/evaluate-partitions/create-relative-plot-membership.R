# It basically binds mem1 and mem2 and outputs a data frame. This data frame will show which cluster in 'mem1' is binded to which cluster in 'mem2'.
# The goal is to create a membership vector relatively to mem1. Thus, when we plot 2 membership based on the same graph, we can catch the small differences.
# It is sometimes difficult to catch those little differences when node coloring is not handled well since node coloring  depends only on how membership vector is created
# Even though 2 membership vectors are very similar, they might be colored very differetnly because of the node coloring/cluster numbering.
# To tackle this issue, we are able adjust the mem2 to see color changing for small membership changes.
# An example:
# mem1: 1,1,2,2,2,2
# mem2: 2,2,1,1,1,1
# Based on this example, nodes 1 and 2 will be colored differently in 2 graphs. But if 'mem2' could be in this way:
# mem2: 1,1,2,2,2,2 => hence, they will be colored in the same way.
#
# This method performs the following things:
# 1) use 'purity' as similarity measure. We use 'purity' because it is asymetric and it captures difference and union of 2 set
#    
# 2) apply the purity measure at cluster level
# An example of output:
#       k   nb.item.in.clu purity         associated cluster id
# [1,] "1" "9"            "0.8889"        "1"                  
# [2,] "2" "6"            "1"             "2"                  
# [3,] "3" "2"            "0.5"           "3,5"                
# [4,] "4" "4"            "1"             "4"                  
# [5,] "5" "3"            "1"             "3" 
# We read line 1 in this way: cluster1 in 'mem1', which has 9 elements, is associated to the cluster1 in 'mem2' with 0.889 sim score
# In other words, 8 of 9 elements of 'mem1' is included in 'mem2'
#
#
# 2) Then, we observe that some purity socres are 0.5, and associated cluster id is multiple. To tackle this, we duplicate each row with multpile cluster id:
#   k   nb.item.in.clu purity         associated cluster id
#  "3" "2"            "0.5"           "3,5"   
#  becomes:
#  "3" "2"            "0.5"           "3"  
#  "3" "2"            "0.5"           "5"
#
# Then, remove non-unique associated cluster ids:
# For instance:
#   k   nb.item.in.clu purity         associated cluster id
#  "3" "2"            "0.5"           "3" 
#  "5" "3"            "1"             "3" 
# Here, 3, which is associated cluster id, is non-unique, because there are 2 rows which have 3.
# We need to select one of them: To us, what is most important is nb item in cluster, then purity score.
# in this case, the best row is: 
#  5" "3"            "1"             "3" 
# Even though nb item in cluster is 2 in this case:
#  5" "2"            "1"             "3" 
# this row is still the best. Becase the purity is 1, which higher than the other value (0.5).
# 
# At the end, we obtain:
# index k nb.item.in.clu    purity associated cluster id
# 1     1 1              9 0.8888889                     1
# 2     2 2              6 1.0000000                     2
# 6     4 3              2 0.5000000                     5
# 3     5 4              4 1.0000000                     4
# 4     6 5              3 1.0000000                     3
#
# If needed, for example for node coloring, we need to fill in missing part of the new mem2. If TRUE, do it
#
# Thanks to this data frame, we can easily construct a new 'mem2' vector

# The problem is the following: it is difficult to distinguish visually if two partitions are similar or when we want to plot them.
#  This is because the membership vectors are created in different times, so they are not supposed to be labelled in the same way.
#  In other words, a cluster labeled as '1' in the first membership (mem1) may be labeled as '2' in the second membership (mem2).
# So, this function creates a new membership vector which will replace 'mem2', because the new vector is built based on 'mem1'.
# So, 'mem2' is supposed to have the most similar form compared to 'mem1'.
# This is performed thanks to the data frame which show the binding information between mem1 and mem2
# At the end, construct the new relative membership based on "k" and "associated cluster id" columns.
# In other words, when mem2 contains 1, put 1. When it contains 6, put 4, and so on.
